This is just a small JavaScript project that I made, which is supposed to plot 
the "dance of Venus" (it produces something like string art or Spirograph,
except it corresponds to Venus's actual movement in the night sky over an 8-year
cycle) in which Venus's orbit along with its retrograde motion results in a
beautiful roselike pattern.

All code is in the public domain.
