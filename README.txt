This is just a small JavaScript project that I made, which is supposed to plot 
the so-called "dance of Venus" (it produces something like string art or
Spirograph, except it corresponds to the planet Venus's actual movement in the
sky over an 8-year cycle) in which Venus's movement, when plotted, results in
a beautiful roselike pattern.
